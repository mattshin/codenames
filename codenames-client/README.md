# Codenames Client

> React UI for the Codenames project

## Quickstart

First, follow the instructions to start the server. Then:
```
$ npm ci --production
$ npm run start:prod
```

This will build and run the production application on port 5000 of localhost.

## Development

This client is a perfect example of how _not_ to use React. I have learned a lot since
building it and cannot recommend using almost any of the patterns that are used in
this codebase.
