# Codenames Project

This is a web application designed to emulate the popular board game [codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game))

## Quickstart
All players should be able to see at least one screen that displays the [board state](https://codenames.mattshin.dev/game).

One player on each team should also be able to see the colors of every word as [codemaster](https://codenames.mattshin.dev/codemaster).

The blue team always goes first. Enjoy!
